## 🧰 Technical Focus Areas
- Vulnerability discovery & exploitation (web & infra)
- Automated scanning & Nuclei template development
- Threat detection & reporting (MITRE ATT&CK, CVSS)
- Scripting & tooling (Python, Bash, PowerShell)
- DevSecOps integration (GitHub Actions, CI/CD Security)

## 🧑‍💻 Featured Projects
<!-->
### 🔹 vulnverse Endpoint Crawler
Python tool for endpoint enumeration and data extraction from sample targets (e.g., `samplecorp.com`).  
Automates crawling and categorization of live endpoints for vulnerability scanning pipelines.
